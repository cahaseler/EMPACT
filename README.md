EMPACT is an open-source implementation of the IP2M METRR Environmental and Maturity evaluation model, developed under sponsorship by the Department of Energy's Office of Project Management in collaboration with the Earned Value community. This project aims to provide a robust tool for assessing and controlling project management maturity and environmental factors. This project is based on the groundbreaking DOE-funded IP2M METRR research by Arizona State University, but is not affiliated or sponsored by ASU and is not based on ASU's proprietary IP2M METRR software.

## Key Features

- Web-based and installable offline desktop applications from a single codebase (no Docker needed for local install)
- Comprehensive Environment and Maturity Assessments based on the IP2M METRR Model
- Multiple assessments in a collection, allowing for assessment of different groups at a single site
- Multi-dimensional data analysis to generate IP2M METRR model results broken down by groups, or rolled up by organization and over time
- AI-powered summarization and natural language analysis to gather insights from written survey results, across data dimensions
- Mobile support for assessment users, allowing completion of surveys on mobile or tablet devices
- Flexible Single Sign On with support for organizational Identity Providers via OIDC or local account management
