    "description": "<p>The project/program culture fosters trust, honesty, and shared values, including realistic portrayal of performance and acceptance of data transparency through open communication. Project/program culture is a system of common assumptions, values, and beliefs, which governs how people behave in teams or groups. Values and beliefs displayed in the project/program should align with the implementation of the EVMS and project/program outcomes. Project/program leadership develops a team culture of trust and honesty where members can maintain open, synergistic relationships. A shared EVMS implementation plan helps develop a common understanding between the customer and contractor, fostering a culture of trust by laying out how things should work. This culture may also be supported by appropriate rewards or incentives for implementation of EVMS and use of EVM data for proactive management; rewards or incentives are tied to meeting project/program goals, as well as performance thresholds. Leaders are visible and accessible. The project/program culture is heavily influenced by the supporting organizational cultures that interact with it. If these cultures are aligned, establishing a team culture is much easier. However, if not aligned, creating shared values may require additional effort. For example, the contractor &amp; customer PM can develop bilateral Rules of Engagement (ROEs) to set expectations upfront. In any case, project/program leadership, and specifically project managers, must ensure that trust and honesty are fostered within the project/program culture, which helps integrate technical information across functional areas. This includes sharing accurate data, both positive and negative, both within and across customer and contractor organizations, with little fear of retribution. Realistic status/ Estimates at Completion (EACs) are communicated at all levels and externally.</p>",

Having a risk committee/team which follows a risk management plan is critical to the early detection of risks. The risk committee/team should have both customer and contractor representation capturing risk events in a risk tracking tool or register.</p><p>The realization of a threat or opportunity should be addressed with a deliberate action that is planned, monitored, and integrated into the project/program to support and encourage an opportunity, or to minimize the impact of a threat, ensuring cost and schedule tools are updated to support forecasts. As the project/program progresses, this integration allows project/program to monitor risks at the time they are most likely to occur. Robust communication within the risk committee/team to the PM and customer supports the analysis and use of risk reserves (e.g., Management Reserve (MR), Schedule Margin (SM), as well as customer cost and schedule contingency) to apply the right resources to manage the threat and/or capture the most benefit from an opportunity.</p><p>Risk events are tracked, with actions and impacts captured in logs to support auditable integration into the EVMS including the identification of risks in the schedule and budget baselines. When risk reserves are used, they should be identified in baseline and status schedules. Risk reserves use is tracked when budget is expended for an associated risk response or action. Risks that have been retired should be traceable to schedule and baseline budget plan revisions and may result in updates to the ETC and/or Budget at Completion.</p><p>Items to consider include:</p><ul> <li>Schedule Risk Assessment (SRA) and schedule forecasting</li> <li>Cost risk assessments and ETC/EAC forecasting</li> <li>Contractual requirements (e.g., Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL))</li> <li>Risk register or risk tracking system</li> <li>Risk trigger metrics and surveillance plan</li> <li>Risk mitigation activities tracked in schedule and cost tools, as appropriate</li> <li>Risk mitigation plan</li> <li>Risk informed contingency documents</li> <li>MR and SM logs</li> <li>Customer contingency log</li> <li>Customer schedule contingency log</li> <li>Risk committee meeting minutes where actions are clearly traceable to all logs and in the schedule and cost systems</li> <li>Other</li> </ul><p><em>References:</em> NDIA EVMS EIA-748-D Intent Guide GL 3, 6, 8, 14, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27; OMB M-07-24; DOE Guide 413.3-7A, change 1, Risk Management Guide, Oct 22, 2015; ISO 21508:2018(E); ANSI PMI 19-006-2019</p>",
