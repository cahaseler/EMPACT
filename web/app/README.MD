# Development Process

All code that is shared between the web and local versions of the application
should be written in the (frontend) folder of the app directory in this root
folder, called web. API code, authentication code, middleware code, and other
web-specific configuration code should be excluded from the (frontend) folder.

If a frontend function needs to perform an action that should be handled
differently when running as a local application, it should call a function in
the /utils/ folder. This function should have the same filename, name,
parameters, and return types in the web and local implementations, but the web
version will likely call an API, while the local version will call a Rust
function.
