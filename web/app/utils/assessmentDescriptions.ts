A WBS displays and defines the products, and/or services, to be developed and/or produced. It is a product structure and not an organizational structure. Only one WBS exists.</p><p>A WBS is a decomposition of all the work necessary to complete all authorized project scope including any revisions resulting from authorized changes and modifications. It uses nouns and adjectives to define work and is arranged in a hierarchy. It is constructed to allow for clear and logical groupings, either by activities or deliverables. The WBS should represent the work identified in the approved Project Scope Statement or Statement of Work (SOW)/Statement of Objectives (SOO) and serves as an early foundation for effective schedule development and cost estimating and map to the authorization documentation. Programs typically will develop a WBS as a precursor to a detailed project schedule. The WBS is accompanied by a WBS Dictionary, as required, which lists and defines WBS elements.</p><p>The goals of developing a WBS are to define the work elements 1) for the project team to proactively and logically plan out the project to completion, 2) to collect the information about work that needs to be done for a project, 3) to organize activities into manageable components that will achieve project objectives, 4) facilitates data collection and traceability, and 5) provides a control framework for integrated project/program management.

The project/program follows an integrated project management strategy to identify and manage risks using the EVMS that would otherwise negatively impact a well-formed baseline plan. It has committed resources, including funding, to ensure that effective implementation of the EVMS is a priority, assuring continuous improvement and accountability at every level of the contractor organization. This commitment ensures the availability and protected time of key individuals who contribute to implementing and executing EVMS in a substantive and measurable way. Typically, this also includes the availability/commitment of other personnel with specialized skills/knowledge, who may or may not be “dedicated” to the project/program.</p> <p>Leadership’s and team members’ attitude and discipline, both at the corporate office level and the project/program level, leads to the correct use, application, and acceptance of EVMS as an integrated project/program management tool (ranging from the definition of work scope to planning and scheduling to budgeting and work authorization, to analysis and reporting to forecasting and risk management). Leadership actively revisits the most effective ways to evaluate EVMS metrics that support decisionmaking. The organization’s policies provide incentives and education to foster support and commitment. The contractor’s team does not choose convenience over following the EVMS regulations and procedures applicable to the project/program. Project/program decision-making, which ultimately drives project results, is collaborative, and effectively relies on EVMS generated data and metrics. Governance is enforced and effective at dealing with the challenges of the project/program.</p> <p><i>Comments: Self-governance refers to the capacity of a contractor to govern autonomously and, as such, is an important approach in overseeing the effective implementation of the EVMS. When a contractor instills integrated project/program management principles using the EVMS in a way that benefits all levels of the organization, the results can guide management decisions, lead to improved project/program execution, and optimize performance of the project/program team.</i></p>",
