# EMPACT User Guide

Welcome to the EMPACT User Guide. We appreciate your interest in learning how to use our tool. However, please note that EMPACT is currently in the very early stages of development and is not yet ready for end-user operation.

## Current Development Status

EMPACT is under active development, with our current focus on establishing core architecture and backend systems. As such, there isn't a functional user interface or end-user features to guide you through at this time.

For the most up-to-date information on our progress and upcoming milestones, please visit our [Project Status](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/wiki/Project-Status) page.

## What to Expect in the Future

Once EMPACT reaches a more stable state, this User Guide will provide comprehensive information on:

1. Getting started with EMPACT
2. Navigating the user interface
3. Conducting assessments
4. Analyzing results
5. Generating reports
6. Customizing EMPACT for your organization
7. Troubleshooting common issues

## Early Development Builds

While EMPACT is not yet functional for end-users, we do provide early development builds for those interested in our progress. These can be found on our [Releases](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/releases) page.

**Important:** These builds are not intended for production use and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Early builds may contain almost no content at all and be focused only on backend or behind the scenes technology tests. We appreciate any feedback on these early versions, which can be submitted through our [Issues](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/issues) page.
