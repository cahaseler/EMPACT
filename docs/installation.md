# EMPACT Installation Instructions

Thank you for your interest in EMPACT. Please be aware that EMPACT is currently in the very early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use or general testing.

## Current Development Status

EMPACT is under active development, with current work focused on core architecture and backend systems. For the most current information on our progress and upcoming features, please visit our [Project Status](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/wiki/Project-Status) page.

## Early Development Builds

While we're not yet offering a functional release for end-users, we do provide early development builds for those interested in our progress. These can be found on our [Releases](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/releases) page.

**Important:** These builds are not intended for production use and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Early builds may contain almost no content at all and be focused only on backend or behind the scenes technology tests. We appreciate any feedback on these early versions, which can be submitted through our [Issues](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/issues) page.

### Installing Development Builds

To install a development build:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/releases) page.
2. Download the latest MSI or EXE file.
3. Run the downloaded file and follow the standard installer instructions, then run the application.

**Note:** These development builds are not signed with a certificate. As a result:
- You may see a warning from Windows SmartScreen. To proceed, click "More info" and then "Run anyway".
- You may need to grant administrative privileges for the installation to complete.
- Your antivirus software may flag the installer. This is a false positive due to the lack of a signature.

Future production releases will be available with a code signature for easier installation.

If you encounter any issues during installation, please report them on our [Issues](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/issues) page.

## Future Installation Options

Once EMPACT reaches a stable release, we plan to offer the following installation options:

1. Web application deployment
2. Local desktop application for offline use

Detailed instructions for each option will be provided here once they are available.

We welcome feedback on our early builds and contributions to the project. Please submit any issues or suggestions through our [Issues](https://github.com/empact/EMPACT/issues) page.
