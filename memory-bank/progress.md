# Project Progress Tracker

*This file tracks the status of major tasks and milestones.*

## Facilitator Dashboard (Initial Implementation - 2025-04-29)

*   **Status:** Paused (Initial implementation and refinements complete; filtering attempt reverted; build error deferred)
*   **File:** `web/app/(frontend)/(logged-in)/[assessmentGroupId]/assessments/[assessmentId]/dashboard/page.tsx`
*   **Completed:**
    *   Created page structure with role-based permission checks (Admin, Lead, Facilitator).
    *   Implemented cards displaying Assessment details (Type, Status, Dates), Assessment Parts (Name, Status), and Assessment User Groups (Name, Status) using direct Prisma queries.
    *   Implemented Assessment Users table displaying User Name, Email, Role, User Group (or 'N/A'), Last completed (attributeId or blank), Last Sign In (Clerk, formatted or "Not Signed Up"), and Sign In Method (Clerk, "PARS" or "Email") using Prisma and Clerk SDK.
    *   Refactored layout to a 3-column grid with Assessment Name in the page title.
    *   Resolved TypeScript errors encountered during development.
    *   Replaced basic user table with reusable `DataTable` component (adding sorting, filtering capabilities).
    *   Wrapped Assessment Users `DataTable` in a collapsible `Accordion` (default open).
    *   Created local copy of `DataTable` component and dependencies within dashboard directory for customization.
    *   Reverted failed attempts to add faceted filtering to the user table.
    *   Implemented interactive "Progress" table showing user completion status per attribute, with filtering options, within a collapsible accordion (`DashboardClientUI.tsx`, `ProgressTable.tsx`).
*   **Deferred:**
    *   Completion of Assessment Users table (Status, Progress %, full conditional styling, faceted filtering).
    *   Resolution of remaining build error in `[sectionId]/page.tsx`.

*(Progress will be updated as tasks are completed.)*
