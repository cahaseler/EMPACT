**Current Activity:** Implementing Facilitator Dashboard enhancements (2025-04-29)

*   **Completed:** Added an interactive "Progress" table to the Assessment Facilitator Dashboard (`web/app/(frontend)/(logged-in)/[assessmentGroupId]/assessments/[assessmentId]/dashboard/`).
    *   Shows user completion status (checkmark or blank) for each assessment attribute.
    *   Implemented using Prisma for data fetching, Shadcn UI components (`Table`, `Accordion`, `Card`), and React client/server components (`page.tsx`, `DashboardClientUI.tsx`, `ProgressTable.tsx`).
    *   Includes interactive filtering options within a collapsible accordion.

*(This context will evolve as the exploration progresses.)*
